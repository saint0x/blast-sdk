- add support for blastconfig.py where devs can specific if they want a specific veriosn of specific package and we will work aroudn it
- can also include other custom configs/versions of packages inthis file, which we will use to nuance blast.toml, thus leading to custom cofigs in the image metadata
- sync logic is robust but we need the 

- rest of cmds beside start/kill need to be implemented

- remove test code from prod code... again

Critical Gaps
    Environment Layer Gaps: [doing]
        Incomplete container isolation (currently process-level only)
        Limited resource control enforcement
        Missing real-time state synchronization
        Weak sandbox boundary enforcement


    Isolation Implementation Gaps:
        Container/Namespace Features:
            Implement basic process isolation
            Add optional namespace support for advanced use cases
            Implement secure boundary enforcement
            Add container runtime basics for process management


        Resource Management:
            Implement basic CPU/memory limits
            Add I/O controls for Python processes
            Implement process count limitations
            Add basic resource monitoring


        Filesystem Controls:
            Implement basic path isolation
            Add read-only path enforcement
            Implement secure mount point management
            Add path masking for sensitive directories


        Optional Future Features:
            Network namespace isolation
            Full container runtime support
            Advanced cgroup management
            Custom network interface configuration
            Firewall rule management


    Package Layer Gaps:
        No real-time pip operation interception
        Missing dependency graph live updates
        Incomplete version conflict resolution
        Limited package state persistence


    Integration Gaps:
        Weak coordination between layers
        No automatic conflict resolution
        Missing transaction rollback
        Incomplete error recovery
