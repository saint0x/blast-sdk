- add support for blastconfig.py where devs can specific if they want a specific veriosn of specific package and we will work aroudn it
- can also include other custom configs/versions of packages inthis file, which we will use to nuance blast.toml, thus leading to custom cofigs in the image metadata
- sync logic is robust but we need the 

- rest of cmds beside start/kill need to be implemented

- remove test code from prod code... again

- make each dir its own types folder, for centralization of types

- ask if we need to implement any more sanitization

Critical Gaps


        Optional Future Features:
            Network namespace isolation
            Full container runtime support
            Advanced cgroup management
            Custom network interface configuration
            Firewall rule management


        No real-time pip operation interception
            While we have the basic structure in interceptor.rs, we need to ensure it's properly handling real-time operations
            The current implementation might miss some operations or not handle them in real-time
            2. Missing dependency graph live updates
            The DependencyGraph is updated in update_from_graph, but we don't have a mechanism for live updates
            We should add functionality to watch for changes and update the graph in real-time
            3. Incomplete version conflict resolution
            While we have basic conflict checking in check_state_conflicts, it could be more robust
            We should enhance the resolution strategies for complex dependency trees
            Limited package state persistence
            We have basic state persistence with save and load
            However, we might want to add:
            Transaction-based state updates
            State rollback capabilities
            Better error recovery
            State history tracking


    Integration Gaps:
        Weak coordination between layers
        No automatic conflict resolution
        Missing transaction rollback
        Incomplete error recovery
