# Blast Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Blast is a high-performance Python environment manager written in Rust, designed to provide holistic Python-level isolation with seamless version synchronization and hot reloading capabilities. It eliminates dependency hell through intelligent version management while maintaining explicit control over package installation.

- ✅ Resource-aware environment management
- ✅ Transaction-based package operations

### 2. ✅ Stability First
- ✅ Explicit package installation with version tracking
- ✅ Automatic version conflict prevention
- ✅ Smart dependency resolution
- ✅ Comprehensive state verification
- ✅ Resource limit enforcement

### 3. ✅ Developer Experience
- ✅ Zero-config hot reloading
- ✅ Automatic version synchronization
- ✅ Clean environment management
- ✅ Intuitive state visualization
- ✅ Efficient resource utilization

### 4. ✅ Reliability & Control
- ✅ Manual package installation with version tracking
- ✅ Automatic state synchronization
- ✅ Cargo-style cleanup (`blast clean`)
- ✅ Atomic state operations
- ✅ Process-level isolation guarantees
